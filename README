= \Metropolis: a key-value store for Rack

\Metropolis is a Rack application used to store key value pairs.  It
seeks to emulate the TokyoTyrant HTTP interface, but allows access to
multiple databases through a single TCP port.  It hashes keys to split
keys between different on-disk databases to work around scalability
limitations of the kernel, hardware and filesystem.

== Features

* Currently supports the {TDB}[http://bogomips.org/ruby-tdb/] database
  along with the TokyoCabinet hash database format, other database
  formats will be supported along with KyotoCabinet, as well as other
  key-value stores.

* Compatible with all Rack-compatible servers

== Hacking

You can get the latest source via git from the following locations:

Inline patches (from "git format-patch") to the mailing list are
preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.

We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as
git itself.  See the Documentation/SubmittingPatches document
distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.  Just
don't email the git mailing list or maintainer with \Metropolis patches.

== Contact

All feedback (bug reports, user/development discussion, patches, pull
requests) go to the mailing list: mailto:metropolis@librelist.org
