= Internal specifications (Rack subset)

For extreme simplicity, our internal API uses a strict subset of the Rack SPEC:

* request input only uses the #read method without arguments
  to read input all at once

* response body must be a single-element Array containing one String

* response headers is a regular Hash

* response status is always a Fixnum
